## ✨ Features

- 🗑️ **Remove bookmark** — directly from the card
- 📤 **Export to JSON** — your data stays entirely with you
- 🗓️ **Date ranges** — export the last 7 or 30 days, a custom date range, or the full archive by tweet date

## ⚙️ Settings

**Right-click the extension icon → Options**, or use the **gear icon** on the bookmarks page.

## JSON output

Each record includes `bookmarkedAt` and `lastSeenAt` alongside the tweet data.
`bookmarkedAt` is the first time the extension observed the bookmark and can drive weekly or monthly processing.
